#### summary of results
### Counts
## normality assumption: conclude spatial autocorrelation
## randomization assumption: conclude spatial autocorrelation
## Monte Carlo CRH assumption:  no spatial autocorrelation
# Conclusion: similarity in counts caused by heterogeneities in population
# size, not similarities in spatial deviation from the mean

### Incidence proportion
## normality, randomization, Monte Carlo CRH assumption: no spatial autocorrelation
## this doesn't account for the fact that our rate estimates aren't as good
## for regions with smaller population sizes

### I_cr for counts
## Conclude clustering of standardized deviations of the
## regional counts
## from their expected values under the CRH

### Concluding thoughts
# 1. normality and randomization assumptions are inappropriate and
# can lead to wrong inference.
# 2.  Tests using counts under CRH and rates do not suggest
# clustering.
# 3.  Strong evidence for spatial correlation of
# standardized deviation from
# regional expected counts under CRH.
# 4.  The apparent discrepancies between 2 and 3 are caused the fact that
# we do not adjust for heterogeneous means/variances across space (the standard Moran's
# i using a common mean and standard deviation).  Accounting for this provides additional
# precision in assessing the spatial similarity of statistically unusual counts.
